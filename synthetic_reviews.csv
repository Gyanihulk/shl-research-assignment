More Like Ultra-Loud:**  While it claims to be whisper-quiet, this diffuser is anything but.  The constant humming and sputtering sound is distracting, making it impossible to use at night or when trying to focus. * **Fickle Mist Modes:** The ""intermittent"" mode seems to have a mind of its own. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, and the ""timer"" option frequently shuts off prematurely. * **Light Show, Not Sleep Aid:** The LED lights are cute, but the color cycle is more distracting than calming. The brightness is also too intense for a relaxing atmosphere, especially at night. * **Empty Promises of Relaxation:** The included essential oil blends are disappointingly generic and have little to no noticeable effect.  * **Short-Lived Humidity:** The 8-hour claim is a stretch.  Even with a full tank, the humidity boost is minimal and short-lived, especially in a larger room. * **Design Over Substance:** The diffuser looks nice, but its functionality is lacking. The water tank feels cheap and the auto-shut-off feature is unreliable.  **Overall, this diffuser is more about aesthetics than actual effectiveness.  It's a fancy light show that does a poor job at its primary function: creating a calming and humidified environment.**  I would recommend saving your money and looking for a more reliable and quiet diffuser elsewhere.","B16252173","B16252173","AG9IBYF6RRTX4G8L8E","2023-10-08 15:48:50.692",3,"False","2023-10-08","15:48:50"
